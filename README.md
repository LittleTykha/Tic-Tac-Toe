# Tic Tac Toe Game: The Final project of my summer semester

# Description

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game made in C# in Visual Studio as my final summer project.

I have not implemented any AI, so two people must play the game.

The game allows players to choose their nickname and desired symbol and features a UI that tracks the score, whose turn it is, and can display the match's history.

Uses the Windows Forms template.
